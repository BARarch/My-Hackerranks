# My Congratulations Point
I come to see that I have reached the precipis

I now know that this is a place that I would like to live, and will live.

From this point I can completly put up or completely shut up.

That is why, as I sign off from this hostel I say congradulations to myself.

The winter was tough, I put myself at the edge of  something major, something unexpected.

I jouneny that has exited, invigorated and got me going in new ways, especially when I was down.

Now, only to get stronger.
