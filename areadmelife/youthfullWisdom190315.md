# I will do anything now to stop wasting the years of my youth
Yes I have gotten old.  Lived in Boston, got an MIT degree, moved to SF, go anther degree.  Moved to New York got my ass kicked and now I am on a bus, connecting to another bus taking me to a city where I will fly to another continent for holifday.  Man, have really matured.  I live at home, and in order to do this trip I had to get thing from stagnant and still to full speed.  I work at a floral design center right now.  What would it be like to terminate that job because I am moving back to the city.  This time for good.
