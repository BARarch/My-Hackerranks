# I will do anything now to stop wasting the years of my youth
Yes I have gotten old.  
Lived in Boston, 
got an MIT degree. 
Moved to SF, 
got anther degree.  
Moved to New York,
got my ass kicked 
...and now I am on a bus, connecting to another bus taking me to a city where I will fly to another continent for holiday.  Man, have I matured.  I live at home, and in order to do this trip I had to get moving going from stagnant and to full speed. 
I work at a floral design center right now.  What would it be like to terminate that job because I am moving back to the city again.  This time for good.
