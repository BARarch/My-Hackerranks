# The Steeler Tie
Right now the Titans are playing the Colts for the sixth and final playoff spot.  The Ravens beat the Browns to win a division title today.  Congrats to them,!  As this game was comming to a close I seen a shot of Heinz fieield where a stadium full of fans and players watched in suspense to see if their team would make the post seasonn.  If the Ravens lost they would recoup the title.  The Browns were driving up the feild only down by two points in the closing minutes, so it looked like they had a chance.  But in the end the ravens won.  The Steelers however ARE NOT mathematically eliminated.  If the Titans and Colts game results in a tie the Steelers get the e  final wild card and make the playoffs.  
I wonder if the fans are still in that stadium hoping for the tie.  That must be fun, and when I say fun I mean agonizing.
