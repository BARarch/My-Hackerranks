# Is the world really a worse place
when more men have fewer jobs
when cops kill themseleves more then get killed on the posts
...and the news doesn't report it
just the emotion stuff
the stuff that divides those with less
and keeps the system of weath production for the few stable
and where for most the only thing left to do is make a way from no way
