Hey... Am I realy blased?  I went and got that space cookie thing more than 2 and a half hours ago and it has not kicked in yet.  I went and got this laptop and started writing this.  The Nederlands is a wholesome place. Beautiful people everywhere, not so much evil and suffering.  Destractions are harder to sell. Well I guess that proves it, my heartrate just fell.  I am not high -at all. BooHooooooHooo.
