# Whats it like to mentally prepare
Now that I meditate mental preparation is definitely easier.  The stress has been totally removed from the process.  I can keep the thoughts and ideas I want about being productive, being  powerful, and release the ones that don’t do this for me.

Tomorrow is an architecture day.  I closed all of the terminal windows on my machine.  Tomorrow will be a day of discovery, a day of drawing and a day of dreaming.  

As I mentally prepare for such a day, I live into more opportunity and less stress around performance.  I am one thought away from everything that I want my life to be, and what if that thought came tomorrow? What if that thought comes now, since I know what tomorrows going to be like?

Regardless if the thought comes or not, I can’t wait!
