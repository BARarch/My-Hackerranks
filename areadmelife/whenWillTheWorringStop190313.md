Not having money is getting really hard. Espessially when I try to do the things that people with money do.
When I go on international trips I worry about getting price gouged at the airport.
When I drive I worry about the loud grown I hear from the front passenger side rotor everytime I stop.
I guess the brake on that side is worn out...
I want to give my father 100 dollars on his birthday to fix it, but I been planning this trip since the end of last month, and now that it is getting close... oh so close... my mind can't get out of a constant loop of the other shoe falling.
That part of my brain that processes dangers and threats is so hyperactive; over finances for that matter.  The worst thing that could happen to me is that I'd get stranded.  I got two strong hands, I can probobly work and make due where ever I i'd end up. I hope I don't start thinking about the megabus going off niagra falls, only in that case I would actually die.
