# Today I noticed

What is up with the time management these days?  I spend more time figuring out what to do than actually doing anything.  Earlier we talked about what it has been like for me, doing all of the things that I do.  I equated it to fighting a war on eight fronts because I identified eight different and unrelated things.

In order to organize these activities, I found a that being intentional about how I want my life to shape up allows there to be meaning in the different things that I am so concerned about.  I want things in my future that I have never seen before.  Things that are not the result of a single skill, career or discipline, but many skills and areas of interests.  I am more concerned about the types of people my future paths cross into more than what I will be doing.  I am more concerned about the relationships I have in a place, more than where I am.  I have organized these fronts or things around where they occur in six statements about how I want my life to be.

## Pathos
>”I will look for jobs I create, 
>make up job titles and search them”
I am learning to mine information about opportunities I want.  Generality around job titles has become a bit vague, and in relation to what employees actually do at companies is highly non-specific and in many cases untruthful.
