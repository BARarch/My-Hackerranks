# Fear leads to anger and coveting leads to saddness
If you find yourself sad, check your coveting
If you find yourself angry, check your fearfullness.
I have been in rotterdam for a week now.
Just like the google interview trip,  I have been anxious through and through.
I have come here for something and my perseption of this trip is based on getting it.
The trip has turnd out well and the place has turned out to be everything I thought it would.
International architecture firms, a healthy culture, civil minded people, and a friendly outlook.
I don't want to ditch my return flight to the states but I do want to make sure I can come back sooner rather than later...

...to stay!
