# Journalism Enthusiast
I changed my occupational headline on linkdin.  I call myself a Journalism Enthusiast now. I have come to finally commit to change what it is that I say that I do from web developer to something else.  Something more fitting.  

Earlier today, in the morning before the football games I noticed something about myself.  

> An attractive Anthony attracts no one
> A happy Anthony is the most attractive force of nature on earth

I have realized that my success in achieving anything or getting what I want in life is a function of being convincing to people.  Using undertones in language that make people want to like me, want to trust me.  This is my power to enroll others.  This is not something that I can fake, force or even generate.  It is a matter of pure Authenticity.  It is either I am happy or not.  Vested or not, Engaged or not.

I am extending this to my career.  In 2015 I made the choice to be a software developer.  I have been programming since the age of 15 and as the internet and ancillary technologies and skills grew around it, I saw this to be an reasonable thing for me to advance in.  Although, it seem to be a good fit for me cerebrally, and I saw achievement at grasping concepts.  There has been a missing element, wonder.

I wish to outline for you what is to be gained in changing what I call what it is that I do professionally, as a means to open up new worlds and restore growth around my career and life enrichment as a whole.  At the same, time it is important to disclose what pitfalls and setbacks I am trying to avoid in making these changes.  I see what I am no longer trying to be, and I am trying to paint a better picture of what it is that I do so other understand, see that I like what it is, and others, in turn, they like me!  I wish for this job description to not only explain the technicalities of my profession, but also explain the kind of person I am and what makes me tick with great accuracy.

## To no longer being a tool
What am I building code for?
What am I trying to gain socially by telling people I am a web developer {Situation with Celeste}
Am I a smuck

## People are dying
I am going to be honest I watch a lot of television.
