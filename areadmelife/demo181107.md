## Creative Specification Phoenix 2.0
The city of Phoenix and the surrounding metropolitan area are the result of sprawling free market developments of the 1960’s.  

The area is rapidly growing and has recently passed Philadelphia to become the 5th largest city in the US.  However the city has a density of around 2,000 people per sq. mi. while Philadelphia’s is around 10,000 per sq. mi. 

Phoenix is a city of nodes. The flat geography of the valley allows the city to be organized on a precise grid of 1x1 mile divisions.

What if every division had a tower to incorporate the additional 8,000 ppl per square mile, allowing the region to achieve a moderate density for an urban area, making its future growth sustainable while hardening it for global warming.

What would these towers be like in the climate and geography? Would the natural views and amenities be exploited more or less?   How would the urbanism change?

## Its not like I know how to loose…
