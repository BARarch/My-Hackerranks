I usually don't write on here, and it is interesting the only time that I will is when my longest ever streak has ended.  The last decade has been rough, I come to this to gain strength, and this is a community I believe every man needs today.  77 Days, longest duration I have ever gone since starting masturbating.  The goal was to get to 90 days during the winter.  Winters are brutal were I am and the last few have been the most depressing, -and this one has been magical.  I got a new job, traveled, and gained more lean muscle than I ever had.  Even after I had to reset about 21 days in because I fapped, a new streak started immedaily after.  During this streak I must say the relationship I have with my own emotions has changed.  They are more intense, and at the same time I am more aware of them.  I am going to be positive about this, reset that counter and start again because this is great!
