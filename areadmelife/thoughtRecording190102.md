# The thought recorder
Today I noticed that I will do anything to remember what it is that I want to do.  I hate the feeling I get when I am aware of something I forgot.  Even if I have to hack my whole life, I don’t want to fall victim to the additional overwhelm.  

## My Best Possible Self and Dreaming
My meditation session was great today.  I could have practiced better because I went through email on my phone just before starting and so I could not relinquish the pressing need to figure out an upcoming trip into washington DC, however the message was great.  

I do know what my greatest possible self is, and I can still dream it too.  I learned that this is not a bad thing, and in many ways dreaming is a form of planning.

> Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we loose the excitement of possibilities.  Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning
- Gloria Steinem

I dream to be a great storyteller and paint pictures for you to help you understand your world in your place in it.  This was a passion that I learned in architecture school which was in an of  itself another dream and another plan…
