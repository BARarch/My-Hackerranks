# What did you think of the wire
Short Answer: WTF is this Sh**
Long Answer: My opinion boils down to two things. First the inauthenticity.  The acting was not great. People are in love with this show, that says a lot.  I understand this. But I live in baltimore, I know a fake new york accent when I hear it.  The moment that italian boss guy came into the room with the two middle fingers for the underling guy I was done.  I went to watch Sirens [eventially fell asleep on that tho].  The second is a matter of taste. I don't consider myself to be big on american crime shows.  I came to this to learn somethings, why was this so critically aclaimed, why was this so good, what was well done about this show.  But in the 20 minutes or so that I was watching I was consistenly fighting a reflex that was generrally telling me to do something else with my time dispite my intentions for watching this in the first place.  II am not a n avocate for the crime culture in america, I find it truely heartbreaking, and stuff like this is a key contributer.  

Honestly I dont like it when I travel or live in other places and tell people that baltimore is where I am from and this is the thing that comes up.  All I can do is ask them "what if that was your home"
