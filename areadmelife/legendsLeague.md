# The Legends League of Code

Coding season is upon us. For months we have been down, inwardly critical of our direction and carreer choices. I began thinking that I am washed up -over the hill. I still have it in me. I cant stop codeing. It is time to call the recruiters, boot up the editors. We have high ground to regain.

This season has a number of camapains all running nearly concurrent. This is good becuase are many places for me to show my skills. Lots of opportunity to practice and show what I can do live. Unlike other camapains with google and with amazon, its not like Ill be 'one and done'. I want to group as many opportunities as possible. My training will have to be adequatly sincronised and coordinated to me deadlines and goals.

1. Nights always darkest before dawm
2. I did not create the darkness. I was left all alone, to sin, just like everyone else.
3. I shall use this darkness in the best manner I can. I will be lacking in many respects. It will be hard and the conditions are such that I will be to focus on this.
