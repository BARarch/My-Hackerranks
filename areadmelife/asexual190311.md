# Asexual
There is no such thing as celibacy or abstaining from sex if it isn't outwardly persued in the first place

Being celibate mean you want sex and are choosing not to engage with that desire.  When the desire does not exist it is thhe identification with sexuality that changes

I am no longer a heterosexual male.

I guess next time I'll prove I am not a man too.
