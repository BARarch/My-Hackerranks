# US Military: The more children you have the more money you get

What if the idea of the United States becomes Prof. Northwestern's military properties map?
What if life as we know it on the mainlands erodes away and what is left are generations of military brats isolated on bases distributed accross the world.
and this becomes the emergent condition.  The Americans are this distributed race of peoples that menace around out in the seas like pirates in underwater ships.
Threatening people on lands with their missiles and marmade jars.

They wi rule the seas and the expanse of the skies.
