# Coding Portfolio
All of the interview prep questions that I have done over the years.  There is also a tester

## Initializing Tests
The tester takes python source code with the following command

```bash goover.sh "MyTestName" --init```

Copy source code into terminal

Adding Cases

```bash groover.sh "MyTestName" --case```

Then copy test case text into terminal

Test Cases

```bash groover.sh "MyTestName" --test```  

When Finished

```bash groover.sh "MyTestName" --submitted```
